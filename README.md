Professional WebPage.

This repository is to access my professional webpage. What is expected is Information about me, links where you can see my socials or contact, my skills, a professional picture of me, professional experience, and a professional timeline. I also have a connect with me section. 

How to Install and Run the Project.

1. Open your terminal (preferable the Blue Visual Studio not the Community)

2. Navigate where do you want the directory to clone the repository. 
Use the cd command to change directories: cd path/to/your/directory

3. Clone the repository using the git clone command followed by the repository URL.
git clone https://github.com/Korvaxus/superPortfolio.git

4. Navigate to the Project Directory
change to the project directory that was  created when you cloned the repository. 
Use the cd command again: cd repository-name

5. Open the HTML file in a Web Browser
If it's in the root of the directory of the project, you can open it directly. If it's a subdirectory, navigate to that directory.
(cd path/to/hmtl-file-directory)

You can also open the HTML File in your default web browser by typing this: (open filename.html)
If you are on Windows you migh want to use: (start filename.html)
If you are on Linux you might want to use: (xdg-open filename.html)

Navigation

When the page is opened the first thing you will see is my name and my brief introduction of myself and next to it you will see my links to my different contact or reach links. Next section is my most recent skills and my professional picture. Next is my Professional Experience as a Game Tester and then a Professional Timelime looking what I have done in the past years. Last thing that I have is where you can send me a message that I will receive and I will see anything I have available. 

Feature

My only main Feature is my contact area in the bottom and it can send me a message that you type.
