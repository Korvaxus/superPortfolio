        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello, I am a Game Designer and a game tester in the world of videogames, I have beta tested a couple games like Dark and Darker and some indie games. But I haven't entered deep in the world of development, possibly I will soon. </p>
        <p>I have played a lot of different games from different franchises. I can say that am familiar with the world of videogames and their mechanics. My favorite type of games is hardcore games.</p>
        <p>One of my main goals is to develop and beta test games. One game that I would like to participate in its closed beta testing is Project Zomboid that they are soon to release its build 42 to the game.</p>
